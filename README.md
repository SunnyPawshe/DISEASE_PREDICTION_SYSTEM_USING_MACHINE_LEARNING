# DISEASE_PREDICTION_SYSTEM_USING_MACHINE_LEARNING
The Disease Prediction System based on various prediction models that help to predict the disease of the user based on the symptoms that user enters as an input to the system. Predictive models with the help of machine learning classification algorithms analyze the symptoms provided by the user as input and gives the name and probability of the disease as an output. Disease Prediction is done by implementing the Naive Bayes Classifier, Decision tree and Random Forest Algorithm. The Naive Bayes helps to calculate the probability of the disease which is predicted.
